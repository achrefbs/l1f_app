## History
The idea of picking players and then running contests on the basis of their year-to-date statistics has been operational since some months after World War II. If we dig deeper, we can find the earliest published account of fantasy sports involving an Oakland businessman and his partner Wilfred Winkenbach – who devised the concept of fantasy golf at the ends of 1950s.
In the modern era, fantasy sports popularized as a fun game being played among friends. But, in no time, it caught the attention of the big guns like Yahoo, CNN, ESPN, etc. Cut to today and the very near future, it is taking less than a half time’s duration to make the fantasy sports market
## How does Fantasy Sports App Works?
The fans choose real players from an online selection process, commonly known as a draft, and assemble a fantasy team. 
Then the real-game statistics of the players are compiled and parallels are drawn to gauge whose fantasy team has performed the best.
The players are able to track how their respective fantasy team is doing through different websites or mobile applications. Some of the players join leagues with their acquaintances and compete against people they only know. While others join the public leagues which are hosted by the websites and compete against the strangers.
